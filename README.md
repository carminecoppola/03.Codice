# DB_Birrificio

This repository contains the database project for the Databases course at Parthenope University of Naples. The project focuses on the creation and management of a database for a brewery. It includes an Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram, a translated UML diagram, table creation with MySQL, related queries, database population, triggers, user creation, views, and a project report. Please note that this project is developed solely for academic purposes.

## Project Description

The Brewery Database project aims to create a comprehensive database management system for a brewery. It involves the following components:

- **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram:** An ER diagram illustrating the entities, relationships, and attributes of the brewery database.
- **Translated UML Diagram:** A UML diagram derived from the ER diagram using DIA, providing a visual representation of the database design.
- **Table Creation:** Creation of database tables using MySQL based on the design specifications from the ER diagram.
- **Queries**: SQL queries to perform various operations on the database, including data retrieval, insertion, deletion, and modification.
- **Database Population:** Insertion of sample data into the tables to demonstrate the functionality of the database.
- **Triggers:** Implementation of triggers to enforce data integrity and automate certain database actions.
- User Creation: Creation of user accounts with appropriate privileges to access and manipulate the database.
- Views: Creation of views to provide customized perspectives on the data stored in the database.
- Project Report: A detailed report explaining the design choices, implementation details, and functionalities of the database.

## Technologies Used

- MySQL: Relational database management system used for table creation and query execution.
- DIA: Diagram creation software used for generating the ER and UML diagrams.
